# vault-plugin-secrets-oauthapp

This is a standalone backend plugin for use with [HashiCorp
Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault).

This plugin provides a secure wrapper around OAuth 2 authorization code, refresh
token, device code, and client credentials grant types, allowing a Vault client
to request authorization on behalf of a user and perform actions using a
negotiated OAuth 2 access token.

## Usage

Once you have the binary, you will need to register the plugin with Vault.
Follow [the instructions in the Vault
documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins.html#plugin-registration)
to add the plugin to the catalog. We will assume it is registered under the name
`oauthapp`.

Mount the plugin at the path of your choosing:

```
$ vault secrets enable -path=oauth2/bitbucket oauthapp
Success! Enabled the oauthapp secrets engine at: oauth2/bitbucket/
```

Configure it with the necessary information to exchange tokens:

```
$ vault write oauth2/bitbucket/config \
    provider=bitbucket \
    client_id=aBcD3FgHiJkLmN0pQ \
    client_secret=AbCd3fGh1jK1MnoPqRs7uVwXYz
Success! Data written to: oauth2/bitbucket/config
```

Once the client secret has been written, it will never be exposed again.

### Authorization code exchange flow

From a Vault client, request an authorization code URL:

```
$ vault write oauth2/bitbucket/config/auth_code_url state=foo scopes=bar,baz
Key    Value
---    -----
url    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id=aBcD3FgHiJkLmN0pQ&response_type=code&scope=bar+baz&state=foo
```

After redirecting the user to that URL and receiving the resulting temporary
authorization code in your callback handler, you can create a permanent
credential that automatically refreshes:

```
$ vault write oauth2/bitbucket/creds/my-user-auth code=zYxWvU7sRqP
Success! Data written to: oauth2/bitbucket/creds/my-user-auth
```

Assuming the refresh token remains valid, an access token is available any time at the same endpoint:

```
$ vault read oauth2/bitbucket/creds/my-user-auth
Key             Value
---             -----
access_token    nLlBg9Lmd7n1X96bw/xcW9HvyOHzxj19z3zXKv0XXxr8eLjQSerf4iyPDRCucSHQN+c7fnKhPsSWbWg0
```

Note that the client secret and refresh token are never exposed to Vault
clients.

Alternatively, if a refresh token is obtained in some other way you can
skip the auth_code_url step and pass the token directly to the creds
write instead of the response code:

```
$ vault write oauth2/bitbucket/creds/my-user-auth \
    grant_type=refresh_token \
    refresh_token=TGUgZ3JpbGxlPw==
Success! Data written to: oauth2/bitbucket/creds/my-user-auth
```

### Device code flow

The [device code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/) grant type
allows a user to authenticate outside of a browser session. This plugin supports
the device code flow and automatically handles polling the authorization server
for a valid access token.

Not all providers support device code grants. Check the provider's documentation for more information.

To initiate the device code flow (this time using [GitHub as an
example](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow)):

```
$ vault write oauth2/github/creds/my-user-auth grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
Key                 Value
---                 -----
user_code           BDWD-HQPK
verification_uri    https://github.com/login/device
expire_time         2021-03-10T23:35:00.295229233Z
```

The plugin will manage the device code (similar to a refresh token) and will
never present it to you. You should forward the user code and verification URL
to the authorization subject for them to take action to log in.

Initially, when you try to read the credential back, you'll get an error letting
you know the token is pending issuance because the user hasn't yet performed the
required verification steps:

```
$ vault read oauth2/github/creds/my-user-auth
Error reading oauth2/github/creds/my-user-auth: Error making API request.

URL: GET http://localhost:8200/v1/oauth2/github/creds/my-user-auth
Code: 400. Errors:

* token pending issuance
```

However, within a few seconds of the user verifying their identity, you should
see the access token:

```
$ vault read oauth2/github/creds/my-user-auth
Key             Value
---             -----
access_token    aGVsbG8gaGVsbG8gaGVsbG8K
expire_time     2021-03-27T00:15:38.72796606Z
type            Bearer
```

### Client credentials flow

From a Vault client, simply read an arbitrary token using the `self` endpoints:

```
$ vault read oauth2/bitbucket/self/my-machine-auth
Key             Value
---             -----
access_token    SSBhbSBzbyBzbWFydC4gUy1NLVItVC4=
expire_time     2021-01-16T15:38:21.105335834Z
type            Bearer
```

You can configure the parameters of the identity provider's token endpoint if
needed:

```
$ vault write oauth2/bitbucket/config/self/my-machine-auth \
    scopes=repositories:read
Success! Data written to: oauth2/bitbucket/config/self/my-machine-auth
```

## Tips

For some operations, you may find that you need to provide a map of data for a
field. When using the CLI, you can repeat the name of the field for each
key-value pair of the map and use `=` to separate keys from values. For example:

```
$ vault write oauth2/oidc/config \
    provider_options=issuer_url=https://login.example.com \
    provider_options=extra_data_fields=id_token_claims
```

## Performance tuning

There are several categories of performance tuning options you may want to
adjust to get the most out of this plugin. All of the options are fields set
when writing this plugin's configuration to the `config` endpoint.

### Provider timeouts

It can be inconvenient when a provider you're working with doesn't respond to
requests in a reasonable time. Therefore, we apply a default timeout of 30
seconds to all outbound requests. We also allow for a bit of leeway when a token
is getting close to its expiry, preferring to wait longer to avoid clients
having to retry requests to Vault. This is applied using a logarithmic algorithm
relative to the usual grace period we'd use for refreshing.

You can set the initial provider timeout using the
`tune_provider_timeout_seconds` option. If you set it to 0, we won't apply any
timeout.

The default leeway factor is 1.5, i.e., a maximum timeout of 45 seconds when a
token is close to expiration. You can set a different factor using the
`tune_provider_timeout_expiry_leeway_factor` option. To disable timeout scaling,
set the leeway factor to 1.

### Automatic refreshing

To avoid having to contact providers when tokens are read from storage and need
to be refreshed, this plugin will automatically check and attempt to refresh
tokens that are close to expiring on a regular interval. The default check
interval is 1 minute. The refresh check has a grace period, called the expiry
delta, that extends beyond the refresh check interval to allow for some overlap.
The default expiry delta factor is 1.2, or 72 seconds.

You can set the refresh check interval using the
`tune_refresh_check_interval_seconds` option and the expiry delta factor using
the `tune_refresh_expiry_delta_factor` option.

If you don't need this behavior, for example because your provider doesn't use
refresh tokens, you can set `tune_refresh_check_interval_seconds` to 0.

Alternatively, if you have a relatively small number of tokens and your provider
issues tokens with very long expirations, you may want to use a longer refresh
interval than the default to avoid having to loop over all credentials in
storage every minute.

### Automatic reaping

There are a number of situations that result in stored tokens becoming unusable.
Broadly, we group these into the following categories:

* Expired with no refresh token
* Expired and refresh failed because the provider rejected the refresh request
* Expired and enough transient errors have occurred to discard the token (for
  example, instead of rejecting a token, the provider hangs the connection)

This plugin can automatically delete tokens that are expired and meet one of
these criteria using a process called reaping. Like the automatic refreshing,
reaping runs on an interval, by default 5 minutes. You can change the reap
interval using the `tune_reap_check_interval_seconds` option.

You can disable the reaper entirely by setting the option to 0, or you can
enable a dry run mode using the `tune_reap_dry_run` option. When in dry run
mode, you can check your Vault server logs to see which credentials would be
deleted.

The criteria are mutually exclusive, so for example, a token that has a provider
refresh rejection will always have that criterion applied to it, even if it also
has transient errors.

Each of the criteria have their own tuning options documented in the `config`
endpoint. Note that the defaults should be reasonable for most users. You can
disable any of the criteria by setting its corresponding option to 0.

## Endpoints

### `config`

#### `GET` (`read`)

Retrieve the current configuration settings (except the client secret).

#### `PUT` (`write`)

Write new configuration settings. This endpoint completely replaces the existing
configuration, so you must specify all required fields, even when updating.

#### `DELETE` (`delete`)

Remove the current configuration. This does not invalidate any existing access
tokens; however, you will not be able to create new tokens or refresh existing
tokens.

### `config/auth_code_url`

#### `PUT` (`write`)

Retrieve an authorization code URL for the given state. Some providers may not
provide the plugin with information about this URL, in which case accessing this
endpoint will return an error.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| `auth_url_params` | A map of additional query string parameters to provide to the authorization code URL. If any keys in this map conflict with the parameters stored in the configuration, the configuration's parameters take precedence. | Map of StringðŸ ¦String | None | No |

### `config/self/:name`

#### `GET` (`read`)

Retrieve the client credentials grant type configuration for the credential with
the given name, if any is present.

#### `PUT` (`write`)

Configure a client credentials grant for the credential with the given name.
Writing configuration will cause a new token to be retrieved and validated using
the `client_credentials` grant type.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| `token_url_params` | A map of additional query string parameters to provide to the token URL. If any keys in this map conflict with the parameters stored in the configuration, the configuration's parameters take precedence. | Map of StringðŸ ¦String | None | No |
| `scopes` | A list of explicit scopes to request. | List of String | None | No |
| `provider_options` | A list of options to pass on to the provider for configuring this token exchange. | Map of StringðŸ ¦String | None | No |

#### `DELETE` (`delete`)

Removes the client credentials configuration for the credential with the given
name. If a token has been issued for this configuration, it will be cleared.

### `creds/:name`

This path is for tokens to be obtained using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code,
refresh token, and device code flows.

#### `GET` (`read`)

Retrieve a current access token for the given credential. Reuses previous token
if it is not yet expired or close to it. Otherwise, requests a new credential
using the `refresh_token` grant type if possible.

If scopes or audience are requested, the current access token will be
exchanged for another access token with more limited scopes or audience,
and the more limited token returned.
The more limited token is not saved for reuse; the less limited one is
saved as usual.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |

| `audience` | A list of explicit audiences to request. | List of String | None | No |


#### `PUT` (`write`)

Create or update a credential using a supported three-legged flow. This
operation will make a request for a new credential using the specified grant
type.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| `grant_type` | The grant type to use. Must be one of `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, or `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`. | String | `authorization_code`<sup id="ret-3">[3](#footnote-3)</sup> | No |
| `provider_options` | A list of options to pass on to the provider for configuring this token exchange. | Map of StringðŸ ¦String | None | Refer to provider documentation |

currently issued token, if that behavior is desired.

### `self/:name`

This path is for tokens to be obtained using the OAuth 2.0 client credentials
flow.

#### `GET` (`read`)

Retrieve a current access token for the underlying OAuth 2.0 application. Reuses
previous token if it is not yet expired or close to it. Otherwise, requests a
new credential using the `client_credentials` grant type.
